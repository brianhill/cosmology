## Various Values used in Examples and Problems

*Often we need real-world values, and often we round them to make it possible to solve problems without a calculator.*

### Some Speeds

* Olympic swimmer: 2 m/s
* Olympic runner: 10 m/s
* Highway speed: 30 m/s
* Fastball pitch: 40 m/s
* Bullet train speed: 100 m/s
* Speed of Earth around Sun: 30,000 m/s
* Speed of Light (exact per 1983 agreement that *defined* the meter as "the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second"): 299,792,458 m/s
* Speed of Light (commonly rounded value): 300,000,000 m/s or 3x10^8 m/s

Note that the fastest speed we can remotely consider ourselves familiar with (the speed of the Earth around the Sun) is still only 10^-4 of the speed of light and highway speed is 10^-7 of the speed of light.

### Some Distances

* Distance from Big Pine to Bishop: 24,000 m
* Distance from Earth to Moon: 384,000 km
* Distance from Earth to Moon (rounded down some to make problems work out tidily): 375,000 km = 5/4 of a light-second
