## Various Values used in Examples and Problems

*Often we need real-world values, and often we round them to make it possible to solve problems without a calculator.*

### Some Speeds

* Olympic swimmer: 2 m/s
* Olympic runner: 10 m/s
* Highway speed: 30 m/s
* Fastball pitch: 40 m/s
* Bullet train speed: 100 m/s
* Speed of Earth around Sun: 30,000 m/s
* Speed of Light (rounded to make problems easier to do without a calculator): 300,000,000 m/s or 3x10^8 m/s
* Speed of Light (exact per 1983 agreement that *defined* the meter as "the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second"): 299,792,458 m/s
  * As an aside, perhaps this definition of the meter makes you wonder: how is the second defined!?
  * It is defined as "9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom."
  * Source: [NIST](https://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1498.pdf) (certainly NIST is authoritative, but it is not necessarily the current definition, since the document is from 2002)
  * In less fancy terms, in 1967, the second was defined to be a certain number of cycles of an atomic clock.

Note that the fastest speed we can remotely consider ourselves familiar with (the speed of the Earth around the Sun) is still only 10^-4 of the speed of light and highway speed is 10^-7 of the speed of light.

### Some Distances

* Distance from surface of Earth to International Space Station: 408 km
* Distance from Big Pine to Bishop: 24 km
* Radius of Earth: r\_E = 6371 km
* Distance from Earth to Moon: 384,000 km
* Distance from Earth to Moon (rounded to make problems easier to do without a calculator): 375,000 km = 5/4 of a light-second

### Some Masses

* Mass of Earth: M\_E = 5.972*10^24 kg
* Mass of Sun: M\_S = 1.989*10^30 kg

### Gravity

* Newton's Constant: G = 6.67*10^âˆ’11 N m^2/kg^2
* Gravitational acceleration at surface of Earth: g = GM\_E/r\_E^2 = 9.8 m/s^2
* Gravitational acceleration at surface of Earth (rounded to make problems easier to do without a calculator): 10 m/s^2
