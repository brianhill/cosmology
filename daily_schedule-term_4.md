Course [home page](./)

### Week 1 &mdash; Free-Float Frames &mdash; Time Dilation &mdash; Tidal Forces

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Read pp. 1-12 of Chapter 1 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) (the link is to a PDF of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L) &mdash; If pp. 1-12 seem straightforward, then you haven't yet read it carefully enough! &mdash; It took humanity from Galileo "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" in 1632 to Einstein in 1905 to progress from Galilean Relativity to Special Relativity (more accurately, Special Relativity was developed by Poincar&eacute;, Lorentz, Einstein, and Minkowski between 1900 and 1907), so read pp. 1-12 until you are bewildered
* Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Definition of velocity, units (the meter, the second, and the speed of light since the meter was re-defined in 1983), spacetime diagrams &mdash; [Various Values](./various_values.html) used in examples and problems &mdash; Derivation of [Galilean Addition of Velocities](./resources/GalileanAdditionOfVelocities.pdf)  &mdash; What "the speed of light is constant" means in terms of Mary's rocket ship and John's lab &mdash; Discussion of pp. 1-12 of *Spacetime Physics*
* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Read the rest of Chapter 1 and continue through the end of Section 2.3 of *Spacetime Physics* &mdash; I recommend you also get started on Problems Set 1 (not due until Monday, Jan. 16, see below) so that you can ask questions about the problems in Thursday's class &mdash; You might as well print out all of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L of [*Spacetime Physics*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) together now, three-hole punch them, and put them in a three-ring binder
* Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; We reviewed *F=ma*, *F=GmM\_E/r_E*^2, the definition of *g = GM_E/r\_E^2*, and the formula *d* = &#189; *at*^2 (some had not had these formulas - for most it was review - come see me if it was too fast) &mdash; We calculated the weakened acceleration of gravity 300km above Earth (the International Space Station is actually 408 km above Earth), and we understood why it seems to Chris Hadfield that "there is no gravity in space" when in fact it is only weakened by 12% &mdash; We discussed free-float frames (pp. 26-28), and even did the algebra for the ink trail on the wall of the falling house example on p. 28 &mdash; We discussed the small amount of calculus you will be using in Problem 2-8 and [a way of getting the needed result for &Delta;(1/r^2) without calculus](./resources/ComputingDeltaOneOverRSquared.pdf) &mdash; We need to further discuss approximations (usually the leading non-zero term is sufficient), and today we only scratched the surface on what is a very general idea of power series expansions &mdash; We briefly discussed the "egg shape" referred to several times on p. 31 (such a shape is more accurately called an "ovoid," although if you look at the etymology and the lay definition, rather than the mathematician's definition, this just brings you right back to "egg-shaped") &mdash; The important thing is that unlike an actual egg, the mathematician's ovoid is not pointier at one end than the other &mdash; The mathematical ovoid is equally pointy at its two ends &mdash; Finally, I [derived the time dilation formula](./resources/TimeDilationDerivation.pdf) (which gives you a rapid way of solving Problem 1-12, although you can also do that problem with invariance of the interval)

### Week 2 &mdash; Length Contraction &mdash; The Relativity of Simultaneity

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 16 &mdash; Problem Set 1 due at beginning of class consisting of these six *Spacetime Physics* end-of-chapter Problems: 1-4, 1-8 (parts a, b, and c only), 1-10, 1-12, 2-6, and 2-8 &mdash; Problem Set 1 [Solution](./assignments/Assignment01-Solution.pdf) &mdash; Continue reading to p. 61 (which is the end of Section 3.3 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf))
* Monday, Jan. 16 &mdash; Discussion of Problem 2-8 and [Falling Spherical Shell](./resources/FallingSphericalShell.pdf) &mdash; We approximated (1+x)^&#189; for small x by first recalling and appealing to Pascal's triangle and the expansion of (1+x)^n &mdash; We computed the volume of an ovoid &mdash; We got started on all three problems for Problem Set 2, due Tuesday &mdash; We contemplated: we say Mary's clock is ticking too slow. But Mary says our clock is ticking too slow. How can both be right?
* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Read to the end of Section 3-5 (to p. 65) of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) &mdash; Do [Problem Set 2](./assignments/Assignment02.pdf) due at beginning of class &mdash; Problem Set 2 [Solution](./assignments/Assignment02-Solution.pdf)
* Thursday, Jan. 19 &mdash; We went through the [Length Contraction Derivation](./resources/LengthContractionDerivation.pdf) as outlined in Problem 3 on Assignment 2  &mdash; We did a lengthy and careful analysis of Einstein's lightning-strikes-the-train-car thought experiment and came to the conclusion that John says the clocks at the front of Mary's rocket are behind, and Mary says the clocks at the "front" of John's lab are behind (what does the "front" of the lab mean? It means the part of the lab that Mary encounters first) &mdash; So now we have derived Time Dilation, Length Contraction, and started to see that forced upon us is going to be the [Relativity of Simultaneity](./resources/RelativityOfSimultaneity.pdf) &mdash; Disagreements about simultaneity are the escape route wherein we can reconcile that John says Mary's clocks run too slow, but Mary says John's clocks run too slow, and John says Mary's longitudinally-oriented meter sticks are too short, but Mary says John's longitudinally-oriented are too short.

### Week 3 &mdash; Red Shift &mdash; Putting it all Together: the Lorentz Transformation

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 23 &mdash; Read to the end of Chapter 3 &mdash; Do Problem Set 3 due at beginning of class (see additional problem added below, and now due at beginning of Thursday's class)
* Monday, Jan. 23 &mdash; We began with the [Exploding Universe Exercise](./resources/ExplodingUniverseExercise.pdf) which is preparatory for Problem 3-10 &mdash; Then we launched into Problem 3-10 and derived the formula for z, the red shift &mdash; Then we did [A Rapid Review of Light Waves](./resources/ARapidReviewOfLightWaves.pdf) (hopefully something you had in high school science), including the basic equations for T (the period), &lambda; (the wavelength), *f* (the frequency), and *c* (the speed of light), and we used the Hydrogen-&alpha; line as an example, &lambda; = 656.46nm &mdash; Then we went through Problem 3-10 (you still need to write it up) and by the time we were done, we had the formula for the relativistic Doppler shift, and we saw why it is commonly referred to as "red shift," and finally we found out what *z* refers to in the [latest z = 11-20 galaxy candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11558) found using the James Webb Space Telescope's infrared cameras &mdash; These candidates were reported in Jan. 2023 and have undergone little confirmatory work, so they are "candidate discoveries," not yet widely agreed-upon, and many of the 87 signals may be spurious or otherwise unreproducible, or at least not have their z-value correctly estimated)
* Finish Problem Set 3 (now consisting of three problems instead of two): Taylor and Wheeler 3-9, 3-10, and 3-11 (I really want to also find time to do 2-13 before we leave Chapters 2 and 3 behind, but maybe we won't have time) &mdash; Continue reading into Chapter L of Taylor and Wheeler up to and including page 100 (including the form of the Lorentz transformation, Section L.4)
