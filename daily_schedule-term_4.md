Course [home page](./)

### Week 1 &mdash; Free-Float Frames &mdash; Time Dilation &mdash; Tidal Forces

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Read pp. 1-12 of Chapter 1 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) (the link is to a PDF of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L) &mdash; If pp. 1-12 seem straightforward, then you haven't yet read it carefully enough! &mdash; It took humanity from Galileo "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" in 1632 to Einstein in 1905 to progress from Galilean Relativity to Special Relativity (more accurately, Special Relativity was developed by Poincar&eacute;, Lorentz, Einstein, and Minkowski between 1900 and 1907), so read pp. 1-12 until you are bewildered
* Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Definition of velocity, units (the meter, the second, and the speed of light since the meter was re-defined in 1983), spacetime diagrams &mdash; [Various Values](./various_values.html) used in examples and problems &mdash; Derivation of [Galilean Addition of Velocities](./resources/GalileanAdditionOfVelocities.pdf)  &mdash; What "the speed of light is constant" means in terms of Mary's rocket ship and John's lab &mdash; Discussion of pp. 1-12 of *Spacetime Physics*
* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Read the rest of Chapter 1 and continue through the end of Section 2.3 of *Spacetime Physics* &mdash; I recommend you also get started on Problems Set 1 (not due until Monday, Jan. 16, see below) so that you can ask questions about the problems in Thursday's class &mdash; Print out all of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L of [*Spacetime Physics*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf), three-hole punch them, and put them in a binder
* Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; We reviewed *F=ma*, *F=GmM\_E/r_E*<sup>2</sup>, the definition of *g = GM_E/r\_E<sup>2</sup>*, and the formula *d* = &#189; *at*<sup>2</sup> (some had not had these formulas - for most it was review - come see me if it was too fast) &mdash; We calculated the weakened acceleration of gravity 300km above Earth (the International Space Station is actually 408 km above Earth), and we understood why it seems to Chris Hadfield that "there is no gravity in space" when in fact it is only weakened by 12% &mdash; We discussed free-float frames (pp. 26-28), and even did the algebra for the ink trail on the wall of the falling house example on p. 28 &mdash; We discussed the small amount of calculus you will be using in Problem 2-8 and [a way of getting the needed result for &Delta;(1/r<sup>2</sup>) without calculus](./resources/ComputingDeltaOneOverRSquared.pdf) &mdash; We need to further discuss approximations (usually the leading non-zero term is sufficient), and today we only scratched the surface on what is a very general idea of power series expansions &mdash; We briefly discussed the "egg shape" referred to several times on p. 31 (such a shape is more accurately called an "ovoid," although if you look at the etymology and the lay definition, rather than the mathematician's definition, this just brings you right back to "egg-shaped") &mdash; The important thing is that unlike an actual egg, the mathematician's ovoid is not pointier at one end than the other &mdash; The mathematical ovoid is equally pointy at its two ends &mdash; Finally, I [derived the time dilation formula](./resources/TimeDilationDerivation.pdf) (which gives you a shortcut for solving Problem 1-12)

### Week 2 &mdash; Length Contraction &mdash; The Relativity of Simultaneity

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 16 &mdash; Problem Set 1 due at beginning of class consisting of these six *Spacetime Physics* end-of-chapter Problems: 1-4, 1-8 (parts a, b, and c only), 1-10, 1-12, 2-6, and 2-8 &mdash; Problem Set 1 [Solution](./assignments/Assignment01-Solution.pdf) &mdash; Continue reading to the end of Section 3.3 of *Spacetime Physics*
* Monday, Jan. 16 &mdash; Discussion of Problem 2-8 and [Falling Spherical Shell](./resources/FallingSphericalShell.pdf) &mdash; We approximated (1+x)^&#189; for small x by first recalling and appealing to Pascal's triangle and the expansion of (1+x)^n &mdash; We computed the volume of an ovoid &mdash; We got started on all three problems for Problem Set 2, due Tuesday &mdash; We contemplated: we say Mary's clock is ticking too slow. But Mary says our clock is ticking too slow. How can both be right?
* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Read to the end of Section 3-5 (to p. 65) of Spacetime Physics* &mdash; Do [Problem Set 2](./assignments/Assignment02.pdf) due at beginning of class &mdash; Problem Set 2 [Solution](./assignments/Assignment02-Solution.pdf)
* Thursday, Jan. 19 &mdash; We went through the [Length Contraction Derivation](./resources/LengthContractionDerivation.pdf) as outlined in Problem 3 on Assignment 2  &mdash; We did a lengthy and careful analysis of Einstein's lightning-strikes-the-train-car thought experiment and came to the conclusion that John says the clocks at the front of Mary's rocket are behind, and Mary says the clocks at the "front" of John's lab are behind (what does the "front" of the lab mean? It means the part of the lab that Mary encounters first) &mdash; So now we have derived Time Dilation, Length Contraction, and started to see that forced upon us is going to be the [Relativity of Simultaneity](./resources/RelativityOfSimultaneity.pdf) &mdash; Disagreements about simultaneity are the escape route wherein we can reconcile that John says Mary's clocks run too slow, but Mary says John's clocks run too slow, and John says Mary's longitudinally-oriented meter sticks are too short, but Mary says John's longitudinally-oriented meter sticks are too short.

### Week 3 &mdash; Exploding Universe &mdash; Red Shift &mdash; The Lorentz Transformation &mdash; Curved Surfaces &mdash; The Surface of a Cylinder

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 23 &mdash; Read to the end of Chapter 3 &mdash; Do Problem Set 3 due at beginning of class (see additional problem added below, and now due at beginning of Thursday's class)
* Monday, Jan. 23 &mdash; We began with the [Exploding Universe Exercise](./resources/ExplodingUniverseExercise.pdf) which is preparatory for Problem 3-10 &mdash; Then we launched into Problem 3-10 and derived the formula for z, the red shift &mdash; Then we did [A Rapid Review of Light Waves](./resources/ARapidReviewOfLightWaves.pdf) (hopefully something you had in high school science), including the basic equations for T (the period), &lambda; (the wavelength), *f* (the frequency), and *c* (the speed of light), and we used the Hydrogen-&alpha; line as an example, &lambda; = 656.46nm &mdash; Then we went through Problem 3-10 (you still need to write it up) and by the time we were done, we had the formula for the relativistic Doppler shift, and we saw why it is commonly referred to as "red shift," and finally we found out what *z* refers to in the [latest z = 11-20 galaxy candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11558) found using the James Webb Space Telescope's infrared cameras &mdash; These candidates were reported in Jan. 2023 and have undergone little confirmatory work, so they are "candidate discoveries," not yet widely agreed-upon, and many of the 87 signals may be spurious or otherwise unreproducible, or at least not have their z-value correctly estimated)
* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 26 &mdash; Finish [Problem Set 3](./assignments/Assignment03.pdf) &mdash; [Problem Set 3 Solution](./assignments/Assignment03-Solution.pdf) &mdash; Continue reading into Chapter L of Taylor and Wheeler up to and including page 100 (including the form of the Lorentz transformation, Section L.4)
* Thursday, Jan. 26 &mdash; Derivation of [Relativistic Addition of Velocities](./resources/RelativisticAdditionOfVelocities.pdf) which was Problem 3-11 parts (a)-(f) &mdash; [Lorentz Transformation Derivation](./resources/LorentzTransformationDerivation.pdf) &mdash; Pretty rushed at end: (a) Introducing the coordinates on a cylinder: *z* and *&phi;,* (b) Pythagorean theorem on a cylinder: *(&Delta;s)<sup>2</sup>=(&Delta;z)<sup>2</sup>+(R&Delta;&phi;)<sup>2</sup>,* and (c) using *&Delta;s* notation instead of *ds* in order to avoid using infinitesimals or any other calculus notation at this point in the course.

### Week 4 &mdash; The Surface of the Sphere and the Torus &mdash; Energy and Momentum &mdash; The Principal of Extremal Aging

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 30 &mdash; Finish reading Chapter L of Taylor and Wheeler and bring any remaining questions about the [Lorentz Transformation Derivation](./resources/LorentzTransformationDerivation.pdf) &mdash; Print out [Taylor, Wheeler, and Bertschinger Exploring Black Holes, 2nd Edition - Chapters 1-7](./resources/TaylorWheelerBertschinger-ExploringBlackHoles-2ndEdition-Chapters1-7.pdf), read Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, and do an extra-close reading of pp. 2-7 and 2-8 &mdash; Keep in mind the cylindrical coordinates we rushed through: *z* and *&phi;* &mdash; Be sure when you run into an equation that looks something like *ds<sup>2</sup>=dz<sup>2</sup>+R<sup>2</sup>d&phi;<sup>2</sup>* to translate it into the far more understandable notation *(&Delta;s)<sup>2</sup>=(&Delta;z)<sup>2</sup>+(R&Delta;&phi;)<sup>2</sup>* &mdash; Specifically, *ds<sup>2</sup>=R<sup>2</sup>*cos<sup>2</sup>*&lambda;d&phi;<sup>2</sup>+R<sup>2</sup>d&lambda;<sup>2</sup>* on p. 2-7 should be translated into *(&Delta;s)<sup>2</sup>=(R*cos*&lambda;&Delta;&phi;)<sup>2</sup> + (R&Delta;&lambda;)<sup>2</sup>* and the *d&lambda;* and *d&phi;* notation that appears in Fig. 7 on p. 2-8 should be translated into *&Delta;&lambda;* and *&Delta;&phi;* &mdash; On Monday, Jan. 23rd, people expressed an interest in what happens to objects oriented or moving at intermediate angles, so the next problem set has three problems involving angles
* Monday, Jan. 30 &mdash; We quickly covered six topics to prepare you for the rest of Chapter 2 and for Problem Set 4. With these topics in hand, you should not need to refer back to Chapter 1, even though the authors occasionally do &mdash; (1) Simultaneity is relative, but causality is not: spacetime diagrams, the forward light-cone, and the backward light-cone &mdash; (2) The energy of a particle, *m&Delta;t/&Delta;&tau;* where *m* is the mass of the particle at rest (this formula does not work for photons); the momentum of a particle, the x-component of which is *m&Delta;x/&Delta;&tau;*; recovering the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy &mdash; (3) The Twin Paradox and the Principle of Extremal Aging &mdash; (4) Group exercise: shortest path between two faraway points as determined by local geometers who can each only straighten paths by consulting nearby points &mdash; (5) and (6): Get a start on two of the problems from the next problem set: Problem L-6(a) and The Torus
* Followup from Monday, Jan. 30 &mdash; Three things got lost in my rush to prepare you for the rest of Chapter 2:
    * In response to Ben, who was looking for additional reasons that things cannot go faster than light, one reason is that *E=m&gamma;* goes to &infin; as *v* goes to *c* (which is easy enough for you to check now that you have the formula for *E*).
	* You get 0/0 in the *E=m&gamma;* formula if you try to use it for photons. Photons are massless and obey *E=p* where *p* is the length of the momentum vector.
	* In the "thinking like a local geometer" group exercise, after 7 hand-offs of the chalk, the initially-jagged path indeed had smoothed out into a gentle arc, but concluding that an arc was the result of the process is not what I meant people to come away with! Instead, the idea was that the 7 steps were enough for you to imagine what would happen after 100 steps, or 1000 steps, by which point, the arc would be indistinguishable from a straight line. Furthermore, all this was accomplished only by thinking like local geometers, each of whom was viewing just three points in their patch, and deciding where to move the middle point to make the path shorter based only on the position of that point's two neighbors.
	
*Getting into the mindset of local geometers is what Taylor, Wheeler, and Bertschinger were trying to get you to do in Section 2.2. This way of discovering the path that a particle trying to "go straight" across a curved surface will take is the direct analog of how we discover particle paths using the Principle of Extremal Aging in General Relativity.*

* Preparation for Thursday, Feb. 2 &mdash; Finish your study of Chapter 2, which will hopefully go well now that we have spent 3 1/2 weeks studying all the prerequisite concepts &mdash; Bring serious questions about all the material so far, especially the last half of Chapter 2 and the most recent two problem sets.
* Thursday, Feb. 2 &mdash; One-third of class was devoted to answering questions about Problem Set 4 &mdash; Another third was devoted to understanding how we get metrics by determining distances on locally-flat patches in a global coordinate system with the torus and the surface of the sphere as our primary examples &mdash; The final third was devoted (a) introducing the Schwarzschild metric and (b) making a start on Sample Problem 1 on p. 3-16, see [Stretching of Space-Part I](./resources/StretchingOfSpace-PartI.pdf) &mdash; This is the first time we have started to use any calculus &mdash; My goal is to make Sample Problem 1 understandable even if you haven't had any calculus by introducing all the concepts in the Riemann integral &mdash; Stay tuned for Stretching of Space-Part II
* Saturday, Feb. 4 &mdash; [Problem Set 4 due in my box by 6pm](./assignments/Assignment04.pdf) &mdash; [Problem Set 4 - Solution](./assignments/Assignment04-Solution.pdf)

### Week 5 &mdash; Our Initial Encounter with Black Holes (The Schwarzschild Metric)

* Preparation for Monday, Feb. 6 &mdash; Study Taylor, Wheeler, and Bertschinger Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 to p. 3-17, but don't yet try to understand Sample Problem 1 unless your calculus is fresh &mdash; Remember that when you encounter equations like d&tau;<sup>2</sup>=(1-2M/r)dt<sup>2</sup>-dr<sup>2</sup>/(1-2M/r)-r<sup>2</sup>d&phi;<sup>2</sup> (which is Equation 5) or  d&sigma;<sup>2</sup>=-(1-2M/r)dt<sup>2</sup>+dr<sup>2</sup>/(1-2M/r)+r<sup>2</sup>d&phi;<sup>2</sup> (which is Equation 6), that you should immediately translate them from differentials into the far more understandable notation of coordinate differences, e.g., (&Delta;&sigma;)<sup>2</sup>=-(1-2M/r)(&Delta;t)<sup>2</sup>+(&Delta;r)<sup>2</sup>/(1-2M/r)+r<sup>2</sup>(&Delta;&phi;)<sup>2</sup> &mdash; Apply this procedure to any "infinitesimals" or "differentials" that the authors use (such as Equation 16)
* Monday, Feb. 6 &mdash; We need to review the Euclidean metric in spherical polar coordinates and the flat-Lorentzian spacetime version of the metric in spherical polar coordinates &mdash; Compare and contrast with the Schwarzschild metric &mdash; We need to discuss why the global coordinate *r* that we are using is known as the reduced circumference &mdash; Finally, I will continue unpacking Sample Problem 1 on p. 3-16 by deriving the integral the authors used to get a precise answer &mdash; See [Stretching of Space-Part I](./resources/StretchingOfSpace-PartI.pdf) and [Stretching of Space-Part II](./resources/StretchingOfSpace-PartII.pdf) &mdash; We need to start looking at Eqs. 24 to 26 on pp. 3-24 to 3-25
* Preparation for Thursday, Feb. 9 &mdash; Study Taylor, Wheeler, and Bertschinger Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 to p. 3-26 &mdash; On p. 3-24, are Eqs. 24 and 25 that you need to rewrite in terms of *&Delta;t* and *&Delta;r* to make them understandable &mdash; I will need to further unpack the derivation of Eq. 26 on p. 3-25 for you, as I did with Sample Problem 1 on p. 3-16, but you already know enough about Eqs. 24 to 26 to use them &mdash; [Problem Set 5 due at beginning of class](./assignments/Assignment05.pdf) &mdash; [[Problem Set 5 - SOLUTION](./assignments/Assignment05-Solution.pdf)]
* Thursday, Feb. 9 &mdash; Let's continue by working harder to unpack Eq. 26 on p. 3-25 &mdash; Let's look ahead to Section 3-8, which is mind-blowing (inside the event horizon, the global *r*-coordinate behaves like a time coordinate, accckkk!)

### Week 6 &mdash; Finish our Initial Encounter with the Schwarzschild Metric &mdash; Start GPS (Chapter 4)

* Preparation for Tuesday, Feb. 9 &mdash; Finish Studying Taylor, Wheeler, and Bertschinger Chapter 3
