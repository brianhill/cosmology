## Cosmology &mdash; Daily Schedule &mdash; Term 4

Course [home page](./)

### Week 1

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Read pp. 1-12 of Chapter 1 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) (the link is to a PDF of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L) &mdash; If pp. 1-12 seem straightforward, then you haven't yet read it carefully enough! &mdash; It took humanity from Galileo "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" in 1632 to Einstein in 1905 to progress from Galilean Relativity to Special Relativity (more accurately, Special Relativity was developed by Poincar&eacute;, Lorentz, Einstein, and Minkowski between 1900 and 1907), so read pp. 1-12 until you are bewildered
* Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Definition of velocity, units (the meter, the second, and the speed of light since the meter was re-defined in 1983), spacetime diagrams &mdash; [Various Values](./various_values.html) used in examples and problems &mdash; Derivation of [Galilean Addition of Velocities](./resources/GalileanAdditionOfVelocities.pdf)  &mdash; What "the speed of light is constant" means in terms of Mary's rocket ship and John's lab &mdash; Discussion of pp. 1-12 of *Spacetime Physics*
* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Read the rest of Chapter 1 and continue through the end of Section 2.3 of *Spacetime Physics* &mdash; I recommend you also get started on Problems Set 1 (not due until Monday, Jan. 16, see below) so that you can ask questions about the problems in Thursday's class &mdash; You might as well print out all of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L of [*Spacetime Physics*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) together now, three-hole punch them, and put them in a three-ring binder
* Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; We reviewed *F=ma*, *F=GmM/r*^2, the definition of *g*, and the formula d = 1/2 *at*^2 (some had not had these formulas, but for most it was review, come see me if it wasn't review) &mdash; We calculated the weakened acceleration of gravity 300km above Earth (the International Space Station is actually 408 km above Earth), and we understood why it seems to Chris Hadley that there is no gravity in space &mdash; We discussed free-float frames (pp. 26-28), especially the falling house example on p. 28 &mdash; We discussed the small amount of calculus you will be using in Problem 2-8 and another way of getting the needed result for &Delta;(1/r^2) without calculus &mdash; We need to further discuss approximations (usually the leading non-zero term is sufficient), but today we only scratched the surface on the idea of power series expansions &mdash; We briefly discussed the "egg shape" referred to several times on p. 31 (such a shape is more accurately called an "ovoid," although if you look at the etymology and the lay definition, rather than the mathematician's definition, this just brings you right back to "egg-shaped") &mdash; Finally, I derived the time dilation formula (which gives you a rapid way of solving Problem 1-12)

### Week 2

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 16 &mdash; Problem Set 1 due at beginning of class consisting of these six *Spacetime Physics* end-of-chapter Problems: 1-4, 1-8 (parts a, b, and c only), 1-10, 1-12, 2-6, and 2-8 &mdash; Continue reading to p. 61 (which is the end of Section 3.3 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf))
