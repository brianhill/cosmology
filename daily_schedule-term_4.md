### Week 1

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Read pp. 1-12 of Chapter 1 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) (the link is to a PDF of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L) &mdash; If pp. 1-12 seem straightforward, then you haven't yet read it carefully enough! &mdash; It took humanity from Galileo "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" in 1632 to Einstein in 1905 to progress from Galilean Relativity to Special Relativity (more accurately, Special Relativity was developed by Poincar&eacute;, Lorentz, Einstein, and Minkowski between 1900 and 1907), so read pp. 1-12 until you are bewildered

* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Read the rest of Chapter 1 and continue through the end of Section 2.3 of *Spacetime Physics* &mdash; I recommend you also get started on the Problems Set for Monday, Jan. 16 so that you can ask questions about it in Thursday's class &mdash; You might as well print out all of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L of [*Spacetime Physics*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) all at once, three-hole punch them, and put them in a binder
