Course [home page](./)

### Week 1

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Read pp. 1-12 of Chapter 1 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) (the link is to a PDF of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L) &mdash; If pp. 1-12 seem straightforward, then you haven't yet read it carefully enough! &mdash; It took humanity from Galileo "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" in 1632 to Einstein in 1905 to progress from Galilean Relativity to Special Relativity (more accurately, Special Relativity was developed by Poincar&eacute;, Lorentz, Einstein, and Minkowski between 1900 and 1907), so read pp. 1-12 until you are bewildered
* Monday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Definition of velocity, units (the meter, the second, and the speed of light since the meter was re-defined in 1983), spacetime diagrams &mdash; [Various Values](./various_values.html) used in examples and problems &mdash; Derivation of [Galilean Addition of Velocities](./resources/GalileanAdditionOfVelocities.pdf)  &mdash; What "the speed of light is constant" means in terms of Mary's rocket ship and John's lab &mdash; Discussion of pp. 1-12 of *Spacetime Physics*
* Preparation for Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Read the rest of Chapter 1 and continue through the end of Section 2.3 of *Spacetime Physics* &mdash; I recommend you also get started on Problems Set 1 (not due until Monday, Jan. 16, see below) so that you can ask questions about the problems in Thursday's class &mdash; You might as well print out all of Chapters 1, 2, 3, and L of [*Spacetime Physics*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf) together now, three-hole punch them, and put them in a three-ring binder
* Thursday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Let's make sure we understand *GmM/r*^2, *g*, and the formula d = 1/2 *at*^2&mdash; We should discuss free-float frames (pp. 26-28) very carefully to make sure you can move back and forth between Newton's and Einstein's descriptions &mdash; We should discuss the fact that Newton's and Einstein's descriptions are equivalent in weak gravitational fields, but that in strong gravitational fields Newton's GmM/r^2 description does not give the right answer &mdash; We will discuss the small amount of calculus you will be using in Problem 2-8 and another way of getting the needed result for &Delta;(1/r^2) without calculus &mdash; We need to discuss power series and approximations (usually the leading non-zero term is sufficient) &mdash; We should discuss the "egg shape" referred to several times on p. 31 (such a shape is more accurately called an "ovoid," although if you look at the etymology and the lay definition, this just brings you right back to "egg-shaped", but we can and should be more precise) &mdash; Finally, I will derive the time dilation formula (which you will be using in Problem 1-12 due Monday)

### Week 2

* Preparation for Monday, Jan. 16 &mdash; Problem Set 1 due at beginning of class consisting of these six *Spacetime Physics* end-of-chapter Problems: 1-4, 1-8 (parts a, b, and c only), 1-10, 1-12, 2-6, and 2-8 &mdash; Continue reading to p. 61 (which is the end of Section 3.3 of [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*](./resources/TaylorWheeler-SpacetimePhysics-2ndEdition-Chapters123L.pdf))
