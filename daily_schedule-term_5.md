### Week 8 &mdash; Mid-Term Review &mdash; Map Energy Conservation

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 12 &mdash; Study TWB Chapter 6 through Section 6.4, which is [pp. 6-1 to 6-12](./resources/TWB-First12PagesOfChapter6.pdf) &mdash; Don't attempt to understand Eqs. 3 to 7; understand Eq. 2 then jump to Eq. 8 and understand it &mdash; Reminder: as always, understand equations such as Eq. 23 on p. 6-11 as *&Delta;&tau;\_*raindrop*=-&Delta;r/sqrt(*2*M/r)* &mdash; Ben will prepare a time-line of when Einstein's equations were solved for various important matter distributions (black hole, uniformly expanding spacetime, rotating black hole, and the charged-and-rotating black hole), and by whom, starting with Schwarzschild solving the black hole in 1916 &mdash; Schwarzschild's 1916 paper has been [translated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9905030.pdf) into English &mdash; A quick look at the translation will explain why we are studying the solutions of Einstein's equations as manna from Heaven, not trying to get those solutions!
* Monday, Mar. 12 &mdash; Ben's presentation &mdash; Extended discussion of how we can get through this material more effectively
* Preparation for Thursday, Mar. 15 &mdash; No new reading beyond what was already assigned for Monday (see above) &mdash; [Assignment 7](./assignments/Assignment07.pdf)due at beginning of class &mdash; 
* Thursday, Mar. 15 &mdash; Presentations of midterm exam problems &mdash; Barely started the detailed deconstruction of Eqs. 3 to 8 of Chapter 6 which is the derivation of the [Conservation of Map Energy](./resources/ConservationOfMapEnergy.pdf) for an orbiting or diving stone

### Week 9 &mdash; Diving Toward the Black Hole &mdash; Shell Energy &mdash; Stones &mdash; Rain

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 19 &mdash; Continue TWB Chapter 6 through Section 6.6 (through p. 6-19)
* Monday, Mar. 19 &mdash; Now that we have conservation of map energy, what does it tell us about the [Shell Energy](./resources/ShellEnergyFromMapEnergy.pdf) of a stone &mdash; What extra relationships can we derive for the special case of [Rain](./resources/RainFromStones.pdf)? &mdash; How [Feynman studies](./resources/Feynman-HowToStudy.pdf)
* Preparation for Thursday, Mar. 22 &mdash; [Problem Set 8](./assignments/Assignment08.pdf) due at the beginning of class &mdash; [Problem Set 8 Solution](./assignments/Assignment08-Solution.pdf) &mdash; Also, a very modest amount of cosmology reading (just Section 14.1 of TWB) &mdash; Here is the final installment of [TWB Chapters 14-16](./resources/TaylorWheelerBertschinger-ExploringBlackHoles-2ndEdition-Chapters14-16.pdf) on cosmology and gravitational waves (we will only get as far as Section 15.8)
* Thursday, Mar. 22 &mdash; A simple worksheet that helps to understand the expanding universe

### Week 10 &mdash; Metric for a Uniform Expanding Universe &mdash; The Cosmological Redshift &mdash; The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 26 &mdash; Continue TWB Chapter 14 by studying Sections 14.2 and 14.3 &mdash; Changes of variables suddenly become very important &mdash; What are the authors doing going from equation 7 to equation 8? &mdash; How about calculating *&Delta;r=(sin(&chi; + &Delta;&chi;)-sin(&chi;))/K<sup>1/2</sup>*? &mdash; You will need the formula for *sin(A+B)* with *A=&chi;* and *B=&Delta;&chi;* &mdash; You will need to make the approximation that *B=&Delta;&chi;* is small and use it judiciously &mdash; If you do this well, you will gain much insight into equation 8 &mdash; Equation 17 is exciting: the Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric first appears!
* Monday, Mar. 26 &mdash; [Coordinate Transformations](./resources/CoordinateTransformations.pdf)
* Preparation for Thursday, Mar. 29 &mdash; Before continuing, study my write-up of [Coordinate Transformations](./resources/CoordinateTransformations.pdf) (the hardest part of what I did in the last class) &mdash; Then continue in TWB Chapter 14 by studying Sections 14.4 and 14.5 only to p. 14-12 &mdash; Section 14.4 is the most intimidating-looking reading yet, but it isn't that bad &mdash; We have worked hard to numerically integrate equations like Eq. 22 &mdash; Set up Eq. 22 using *&Delta;t* and *&Delta;&chi;* instead of infinitesimals and integrals &mdash; Also, make sure you can get Eq. 31 from Eq. 17 (and write those equations using *&Delta;*'s instead of infinitesimals) &mdash; The bottom of p. 14-12 (on which Eq. 31 appears) is a good place to stop &mdash; [Problem Set 9](./assignments/Assignment09.pdf) due at beginning of class is mostly writing out the coordinate transformations we have been studying &mdash; [Problem Set 9 Solution](./assignments/Assignment09-Solution.pdf)
* Thursday, Mar. 29 &mdash; The residual radiation from t=370,000 years, when the temperature was about 3000K and protons and electrons cooled enough to combine into Hydrogen (mostly, some Helium too) and photons were no longer scattered by matter &mdash; [Penzias and Wilson 1965 - With Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 2011 image](./resources/PenziasAndWilsonWithWMAP.pdf) &mdash; Derivation of the [Cosmological Redshift](./resources/CosmologicalRedshift.pdf) (yet again we translate into the ordinary and intuitive language of small changes and sums what TWB do with infinitesimals and integrals)

### Week 11 &mdash; Black-Body Radiation &mdash; Conservation of Radial Momentum in the FRW Metric &mdash; Luminosity and The Magnitude System

* Preparation for Monday, Apr. 3 &mdash; Go back and study everything you have in both of the textbooks we are using on the Principle of Maximal Aging and my handout where I derived the [Conservation of Map Energy](./resources/ConservationOfMapEnergy.pdf) from the Principle of Maximal Aging &mdash; There is a small but significant mistake in Box 4 on TWB p. 14-13 &mdash; Find it and then understand the rest of the formulae in the box &mdash; Use everything you've learned to understand the rest of Section 14.5 (through p. 14-16) &mdash; The stones are now galaxies! &mdash; TWB are trying to find things that are true about the motion of galaxies through a uniform universe described by the FRW metric
* Monday, Apr. 3 &mdash; [Conservation of Radial Momentum](./resources/ConservationOfRadialMomentum.pdf) in the FRW Metric
* Preparation for Thursday, Apr. 6 &mdash; Study TWB Section 14.6 &mdash; Study the [Leavitt-Pickering Period-Luminosity paper](./resources/LeavittPickering25Variables.pdf) and [Hubble's 1929 paper](./resources/Hubbles1929Paper.pdf) &mdash; Do [Problem Set 10](./assignments/Assignment10.pdf) &mdash; [Problem Set 10 Solution](./assignments/Assignment10-Solution.pdf)
* Thursday, Apr. 6 &mdash; Luminosity, Luminosity Distance, The Magnitude System

### Week 12 &mdash; Relationship of Hubble's Law to the FRW Metric &mdash; Luminosity Distance &mdash; Friedman Equation

* Preparation for Monday, Apr. 10 &mdash; Finish studying Chapter 14 of TWB
* Monday, Apr. 10 &mdash; We re-derived the redshift formula from Special Relativity, which TWB have as Eq. 47 on p. 14-21 &mdash; I derived Eq. 60 on p. 14-24 which relates [Hubble's Law and the FRW Metric](./resources/HubblesLawAndTheFRWMetric.pdf) &mdash; In short, H = dR/dt / R
* Preparation for Thursday, Apr. 13 &mdash; Complete your study of pp. 14-22 and 14-23 (especially Box 6 on the luminosity distance) &mdash; Study TWB Sections 15.1 and 15.2
* Thursday, Apr. 13 &mdash; Photons and Luminosity Distance (Box 6 on p. 14-22) &mdash; TWB Section 15.3 &mdash; [Problem Set 11](./assignments/Assignment11.pdf) &mdash; [Problem Set 11 Solution](./assignments/Assignment11-Solution.pdf)

### Week 13 &mdash; Solving the Friedman Equation in the Presence of Matter, Energy, and Dark Energy

* Preparation for Monday, Apr. 17 &mdash; Study TWB Sections 15.4 and 15.5
* Monday, Apr. 17 &mdash; We only got as far as Eq. 26 at the beginning of 15.5 &mdash; A simplifying surprise is that the sum of the densities of all types of matter today is (within experimental error) equal to the critical density, which says that to the best we can observe it, *K=0.* That was important to deriving Eq. 26 at the beginning of Section 15.5 from Eq. 22 in Section 15.4
* Preparation for Thursday, Apr. 20 &mdash; Study TWB Sections 15.6 and 15.7 &mdash; However, much of the discussion in 15.7 is trying for another way of motivating the fact that &Omega;<sub>&Lambda;</sub> can cause accelerating expansion and that isn't really necessary if you accept that the dark energy is vacuum energy and is the energy of the vacuum (empty space) and therefore does not spread out as more vacuum (empty space) is created &mdash; The goal of the current reading is to understand how a matter-dominated, a radiation-dominated, and a dark-energy-dominated universe evolves &mdash; Because of the different powers of *a(t)* in the Friedman equation, our universe goes or will go through all three phases &mdash; 

### Week 14 &mdash; Term 5 Exam &mdash; The Principle Evidence for Dark Matter and Dark Energy

* Monday, Apr. 24 &mdash; Term 5 exam covering the same material as this term's Problem Sets 7 to 11
* Preparation for Thursday, Apr. 27 &mdash; [Problem Set 12](./assignments/Assignment12.pdf) &mdash; I will cover the critical parts of TWB sections 15.8, 15.9 and 15.10 in the last class 
* Thursday, Apr. 27 &mdash; The observed contents of the universe and the evidence for dark matter and dark energy
