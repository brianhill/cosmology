### Week 8 &mdash; Mid-Term Review &mdash; Map Energy Conservation

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 12 &mdash; Study TWB Chapter 6 through Section 6.4, which is [pp. 6-1 to 6-12](./resources/TWB-First12PagesOfChapter6.pdf) &mdash; Don't attempt to understand Eqs. 3 to 7; understand Eq. 2 then jump to Eq. 8 and understand it &mdash; Reminder: as always, understand equations such as Eq. 23 on p. 6-11 as *&Delta;&tau;\_*raindrop*=-&Delta;r/sqrt(*2*M/r)* &mdash; Ben will prepare a time-line of when Einstein's equations were solved for various important matter distributions (black hole, uniformly expanding spacetime, rotating black hole, and the charged-and-rotating black hole), and by whom, starting with Schwarzschild solving the black hole in 1916 &mdash; Schwarzschild's 1916 paper has been [translated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9905030.pdf) into English &mdash; A quick look at the translation will explain why we are studying the solutions of Einstein's equations as manna from Heaven, not trying to get those solutions!
* Monday, Mar. 12 &mdash; Ben's presentation &mdash; Extended discussion of how we can get through this material more effectively
* Preparation for Thursday, Mar. 15 &mdash; No new reading beyond what was already assigned for Monday (see above) &mdash; [Assignment 7](./assignments/Assignment07.pdf)due at beginning of class &mdash; 
* Thursday, Mar. 15 &mdash; Presentations of midterm exam problems &mdash; Barely started the detailed deconstruction of Eqs. 3 to 8 of Chapter 6 which is the derivation of the [Conservation of Map Energy](./resources/ConservationOfMapEnergy.pdf) for an orbiting or diving stone

### Week 9 &mdash; Diving Toward the Black Hole &mdash; Shell Energy &mdash; Stones &mdash; Rain

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 19 &mdash; Continue TWB Chapter 6 through Section 6.6 (through p. 6-19)
* Monday, Mar. 19 &mdash; Now that we have conservation of map energy, what does it tell us about the [Shell Energy](./resources/ShellEnergyFromMapEnergy.pdf) of a stone &mdash; What extra relationships can we derive for the special case of [Rain](./resources/RainFromStones.pdf)? &mdash; How [Feynman studies](./resources/Feynman-HowToStudy.pdf)
* Preparation for Thursday, Mar. 22 &mdash; [Problem Set 8](./assignments/Assignment08.pdf) due at the beginning of class &mdash; [Problem Set 8 Solution](./assignments/Assignment08-Solution.pdf) &mdash; Also, a very modest amount of cosmology reading (just Section 14.1 of TWB) &mdash; Here is the final installment of [TWB Chapters 14-16](./resources/TaylorWheelerBertschinger-ExploringBlackHoles-2ndEdition-Chapters14-16.pdf) on cosmology and gravitational waves
* Thursday, Mar. 22 &mdash; A simple worksheet that helps to understand the expanding universe

### Week 10 &mdash; Metric for a Uniform Expanding Universe &mdash; The Cosmological Redshift

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 26 &mdash; Continue TWB Chapter 14 by studying Sections 14.2 and 14.3 &mdash; Changes of variables suddenly become very important &mdash; What are the authors doing going from equation 7 to equation 8? &mdash; How about calculating *&Delta;r=(sin(&chi; + &Delta;&chi;)-sin(&chi;))/K<sup>1/2</sup>*? &sup; &mdash; You will need the formula for *sin(A+B)* with *A=&chi;* and *B=&Delta;&chi;* &mdash; You will need to make the approximation that *B=&Delta;&chi;* is small and use it judiciously &mdash; If you do this well, you will gain much insight into equation 8 &mdash; Equation 17 is exciting: the Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric first appears!
* Monday, Mar. 26 &mdash; [Coordinate Transformations](./resources/CoordinateTransformations.pdf)
* Preparation for Thursday, Mar. 29 &mdash; Before continuing, study my write-up of [Coordinate Transformations](./resources/CoordinateTransformations.pdf) (the hardest part of what I did in the last class) &mdash; Then continue in TWB Chapter 14 by studying Sections 14.4 and 14.5 only to p. 14-12 &mdash; Section 14.4 is the most intimidating-looking reading yet, but it isn't that bad &mdash; We have worked hard to numerically integrate equations like Eq. 22 &mdash; Set up Eq. 22 using *&Delta;t* and *&Delta;&chi;* instead of infinitesimals and integrals &mdash; Also, make sure you can get Eq. 31 from Eq. 17 (and write those equations using *&Delta;*'s instead of infinitesimals) &mdash; The bottom of p. 14-12 (on which Eq. 31 appears) is a good place to stop &mdash; [Problem Set 9](./assignments/Assignment09.pdf) due at beginning of class is mostly writing out the coordinate transformations we have been studying
* Thursday, Mar. 29 &mdash; The residual radiation from t=370,000 years, when the temperature was about 3000K and protons and electrons cooled enough to combine into Hydrogen (mostly, some Helium too) and photons were no longer scattered by matter &mdash; [Penzias and Wilson 1965 - With Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 2011 image](./resources/PenziasAndWilsonWithWMAP.pdf) &mdash; Derivation of the [Cosmological Redshift](./resources/CosmologicalRedshift.pdf) (yet again we translate into the ordinary and intuitive language of small changes and sums what TWB do with infinitesimals and integrals)
