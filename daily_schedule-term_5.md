### Week 8 &mdash; Energy Conservation

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 12 &mdash; Study TWB Chapter 6 through Section 6.4, which is [pp. 6-1 to 6-12](./resources/TWB-First12PagesOfChapter6.pdf) &mdash; Don't attempt to understand Eqs. 3 to 7; understand Eq. 2 then jump to Eq. 8 and understand it &mdash; Reminder: as always, understand equations such as Eq. 23 on p. 6-11 as *&Delta;&tau;\_*raindrop*=-&Delta;r/sqrt(*2*M/r)* &mdash; Ben will prepare a time-line of when Einstein's equations were solved for various important matter distributions (black hole, uniformly expanding spacetime, rotating black hole, and the charged-and-rotating black hole), and by whom, starting with Schwarzschild solving the black hole in 1916 &mdash; Schwarzschild's 1916 paper has been [translated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9905030.pdf) into English &mdash; A quick look at the translation will explain why we are studying the solutions of Einstein's equations as manna from Heaven, not trying to get those solutions!
* Monday, Mar. 12 &mdash; Ben's presentation &mdash; Extended discussion of how we can get through this material more effectively
* Preparation for Thursday, Mar. 15 &mdash; No new reading beyond what was already assigned for Monday (see above) &mdash; Assignment 7 is just to write up, hand out, and present problems from the [Term 4 Exam](./exams/Term4Exam.pdf): Clara and Ben jointly have Problems 1 and 2 (they are working together but will divide their handouts and presentations); Drew has Problem 3; Ethan and Max have Problem 4 (Gargantuan), and they will find some way to divide up their handouts and presentations (maybe Max does parts (a)-(c) and Ethan does parts (d) and (e)?) &mdash; Please be clear and efficient and make your handouts complete and of good quality &mdash; Come with 6 copies of your handouts &mdash; You may consult my [Term 4 Exam Solution](./exams/Term4Exam-Solution.pdf) if you find yourself really stuck, or better yet, come talk to me about whatever you are stuck on
* Thursday, Mar. 15 &mdash; Presentations of midterm exam problems

### Week 9 &mdash; Plunging Through the Event Horizon &mdash; Rain Coordinates

* Preparation for Monday, Mar. 19 &mdash; Continue TWB Chapter 6 through Section 6.6 (through p. 6-19)
* Monday, Mar. 19 &mdash; The detailed deconstruction of Eqs. 3 to 8 of Chapter 6 &mdash; These equations are the derivation of the [Conservation of Map Energy](./resources/ConservationOfMapEnergy.pdf) for an orbiting or a plunging object
